[features]
# With shields_up you enable explicit assertions of pre/post conditions and invariants in critical
# codepaths that cannot be proved safe by the rust compiler. Every such assertion should be proven
# correct by an associated comment. We use shields_up instead of debug_assertion to have it separated
# from debug mode (shields_up is not strictly for debugging, its a general safety net / troubleshooting
# measure). For official releases and benchmarks, you should disable shields_up to avoid unnecessary
# performance penalty. Avoid introducing dead code when shields_up is enabled - this will mess with test coverage.
