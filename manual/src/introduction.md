# Introduction

AEON is available as an online tool at [https://biodivine.fi.muni.cz/aeon/](https://biodivine.fi.muni.cz/aeon/). On this website, you can pick the version of AEON you want to use, and you will be redirected to its online interface, which should look similar to this:

> If you for whatever reason cannot access this website, there is a mirror on [Github pages](https://sybila.github.io/aeon/), but the version there may not be always up to date. Alternatively, you can also run your own instance of AEON. It is a simple static HTML/JavaScript website, and the sources are available on [Github](https://github.com/sybila/biodivine-aeon-client).

Out of the box, AEON allows you to perform basic actions, like creating a simple Boolean network. However, AEON uses a native *compute engine* which handles computationally intensive tasks. Therefore, to do almost anything beside editing Boolean networks, you need a compute engine the website can connect to.
