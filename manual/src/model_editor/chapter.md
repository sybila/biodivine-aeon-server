# Model Editor

In this chapter, we discuss how to create, import, modify, and export Boolean networks, as well as how to enhance them with logical parameters. If you only want to work with existing Boolean networks (available as `.sbml` or `.aeon` file), i.e. you are not planning to edit the network, just import it, you can skip to the last section of this chapter.
